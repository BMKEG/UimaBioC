Recent work suggests a link between endocytic trafficking and mTORC1 signaling. This paper demonstrates a specific requirement for the integrity of the late endosomal compartment for amino acid and insulin-stimulated mTORC1 signaling to downstream effectors.
The multisubunit mTORC1 complex integrates signals from growth factors and nutrients to regulate protein synthesis, cell growth, and autophagy. To examine how endocytic trafficking might be involved in nutrient regulation of mTORC1, we perturbed specific endocytic trafficking pathways and measured mTORC1 activity using S6K1 as a readout. When early/late endosomal conversion was blocked by either overexpression of constitutively active Rab5 (Rab5CA) or knockdown of the Rab7 GEF hVps39, insulin- and amino acid-stimulated mTORC1/S6K1 activation were inhibited, and mTOR localized to hybrid early/late endosomes. Inhibition of other stages of endocytic trafficking had no effect on mTORC1. Overexpression of Rheb, which activates mTOR independently of mTOR localization, rescued mTORC1 signaling in cells expressing Rab5CA, whereas hyperactivation of endogenous Rheb in TSC2-/- MEFs did not. These data suggest that integrity of late endosomes is essential for amino acid- and insulin-stimulated mTORC1 signaling and that blocking the early/late endosomal conversion prevents mTOR from interacting with Rheb in the late endosomal compartment.
INTRODUCTION
The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is found in two complexes in eukaryotes: mTORC1, which integrates nutrient and hormonal regulation of protein synthesis and cell growth, and mTORC2, which phosphorylates Akt on Ser473 and plays a role in actin cytoskeletal rearrangements (Sarbassov et al., 2005; Wullschleger et al., 2006). mTORC1 activity is stimulated by growth factors such as insulin and by nutrients such as amino acids and glucose (Harris and Lawrence, 2003; Jaeschke et al., 2004; Sarbassov et al., 2005; Tee and Blenis, 2005; Avruch et al., 2006; Mamane et al., 2006). mTORC1 regulates protein synthesis at least in part through the phosphorylation of two downstream targets, the translational activator S6K1 and the translational inhibitor 4EBP1 (Hay and Sonenberg, 2004). Activation of mTORC1/S6K1 signaling also leads to the inhibitory phosphorylation of IRS-1, initiating a negative feedback loop acting on insulin receptor signaling (Um et al., 2004, 2006; Tremblay et al., 2007) .
There is strong evidence that mTORC1 function is involved in and/or regulated by endosomal trafficking. In Drosophila melanogaster, TOR has been shown to positively regulate endocytosis while specifically inhibiting degradation of the amino acid transporter slimfast (Hennig et al., 2006). TOR itself has been localized to endocytic compartments both in yeast and fly (Kunz et al., 2000; Chen and Kaiser, 2003; Wedaman et al., 2003), and more recently an amino acid-driven localization of mTOR to late endosomes was described in mammalian cell culture (Sancak et al., 2008). Furthermore, a direct upstream activator of mTORC1, the GTPase Rheb, alters endosomal morphology when overexpressed (Saito et al., 2005) and localizes to late endosomes (Sancak et al., 2008). The GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rheb, the TSC1/2 complex, also has GAP activity toward the early endosomal GTPase, Rab5, implicating it in endosomal trafficking (Xiao et al., 1997).
Given the connections between mTORC1 and endocytic trafficking, we examined whether perturbation of particular stages of endocytic trafficking would alter mTORC1/S6K1 signaling. We find that constitutively activate Rab5 abrogates mTORC1 signaling, whereas perturbation of other stages of endocytic trafficking has no effect on mTORC1 signaling. Constitutively active Rab5 mutants block early to late endosomal conversion (Rink et al., 2005), leading to the formation of hybrid endosomal compartments containing both early and late endosomal markers. We find that mTOR localizes to this hybrid compartment when endosomal conversion is blocked. Blocking endosomal conversion by knockdown of a key member of the HOPS complex, hVps39, also produces merged early/late endosomes (Rink et al., 2005) and inhibits mTORC1 signaling. Our results suggest that mTORC1 signaling requires the integrity of late endosomes.

For amino acid-signaling experiments, transfected HEK293T cells were incubated for 50 min in amino acid- and serum-free RPMI and then stimulated without or with 1x complete amino acid solution plus glutamine for 10 min. Lysis, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot procedures were performed as described above.

RESULTS
Overexpression of Constitutively Active Rab5 Blocks Activation of mTORC1/S6K1
Numerous recent studies have suggested a connection between mTORC1 signaling with endosomes (Kunz et al., 2000; Chen and Kaiser, 2003; Wedaman et al., 2003; Hennig et al., 2006; Sancak et al., 2008). Rab5 plays a major regulatory role in endosomal trafficking (Bucci et al., 1992; Stenmark et al., 1994; Zerial and McBride, 2001; Murray et al., 2002). We therefore examined whether mutants of Rab5 would affect insulin and amino acid stimulation of mTORC1. As previously described (Stenmark et al., 1994), overexpression of Rab5WT caused a slight enlargement of early endosomes, whereas overexpression of Rab5Q79L, a GTPase-deficient mutant of Rab5 (henceforth referred to as Rab5CA), caused a striking enlargement of endosomes (data not shown). Also as described (Stenmark et al., 1994), overexpression of a GTP-binding defective Rab5 mutant, Rab5S34N (henceforth referred to as Rab5DN), inhibited the early endosomal localization of EEA1 (data not shown). To evaluate effects of Rab5 mutants on mTORC1 signaling, we overexpressed Rab5 cDNAs and measured phosphorylation of HA-S6K1 at T389 as a readout of mTORC1 activity (Hay and Sonenberg, 2004). Rab5DN led to a modest decrease in insulin-stimulated S6K1 activation, whereas Rab5WT significantly inhibited, and Rab5CA completely inhibited insulin-stimulated S6K1 activation (Figure 1, A and B). Stimulation of S6K1 phosphorylation by amino acids was also inhibited by Rab5CA, suggesting an effect on the nutrient arm of the mTORC1 signaling pathway (Figure 1, E and F). However, the inhibition of mTORC1 signaling was not due to a block in the growth factor-signaling arm of the mTORC1 pathway, because no significant effect on insulin-stimulated Myc-Akt T308 phosphorylation was observed (Figure 1, C and D). Furthermore, overexpression of Rab5CA decreased the activation of endogenous pS6K1 by insulin in HEK293E cells, and by amino acids in HEK293T cells (Figure 1G). Taken together, these experiments show that constitutive activation of Rab5 blocks amino acid- and insulin-stimulated mTORC1 signaling.

Perturbation of Endocytic Trafficking Does Not Inhibit mTORC1/S6K1 Signaling
We next investigated whether the inhibition of mTORC1/S6K1 by Rab5 was specific or reflected a more general requirement for endosomal trafficking. To test this question, we perturbed particular stages of endosomal trafficking using various constitutively active or dominant negative cDNA constructs (Table 1). Expression of each mutant led to the expected inhibition of receptor internalization, receptor recycling, multivesicular body (MVB) formation, endosome/Golgi trafficking, and late endosome/lysosome fusion (Table 1, Figures S1 and S2). However, none of these mutants had any effect on insulin-stimulated mTORC1/S6K1 signaling (Figures S1 and S2). These data suggest that constitutive activation of Rab5, but not inhibition of upstream or downstream steps in endocytic trafficking, blocks mTORC1 signaling.

Overexpression of Rheb, But Not Increased Activation of Endogenous Rheb, Rescues mTORC1/S6K1 Signaling in Cells Expressing Rab5CA
To explore the mechanism by which Rab5CA inhibits mTORC1/S6K1 signaling, we first examined whether Rab5CA inhibition of mTORC1 could be due to decreases in nutrient uptake. However, uptake of both leucine and glucose were unaffected by expression of Rab5CA (Supplemental Figure 3). Similarly, expression of Rab5CA did not increase basal activation of AMPK, and in fact led to a slight decrease in AMPK phosphorylation in 2-DG-treated cells (Supplemental Figure 4A). As others have shown, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is minimally activated in HEK cells by insulin (Herbert et al., 2000), and we did not detect insulin-stimulated activation of ERK in control or Rab5CA-expressing cells (data not shown). Together with the data on Akt activation, this suggests that Rab5CA inhibition of mTORC1 signaling is not due to changes in upstream signaling. Next we examined whether mTORC1 complex stability or formation was altered by overexpression of Rab5CA. However, the ability of endogenous mTOR to coimmunoprecipitate with overexpressed Myc-Raptor was unaffected by expression of Rab5CA (Supplemental Figure 4B). Finally, given the role Rab5 plays in recruiting hVps34 to early endosomes (Murray et al., 2002) and the role of hVps34 in mTORC1 signaling in cultured mammalian cells (Byfield et al., 2005; Nobukuni et al., 2005), we explored the possibility that Rab5CA was sequestering hVps34 away from its site of action in mTORC1 signaling. However, overexpression of hVps34 along with hVps15 in a bicistronic vector (Yan et al., 2009) did not rescue the inhibition of mTOR signaling by Rab5CA (Supplemental Figure 4C).
Overexpression of Rheb activates mTORC1 independently of amino acids (Long et al., 2005a,b), presumably by overcoming the requirement for the amino acid-induced translocation of mTORC1 to late endosomes (Sancak et al., 2008). We therefore tested whether Rheb overexpression would relieve the inhibition of mTORC1 by Rab5CA. Interestingly, Rheb overexpression led to constitutive activation of S6K1 in both control and Rab5CA-expressing cells (Figure 2, A and B). We next tested whether activation of endogenous Rheb could reverse the effects of Rab5CA. We overexpressed Rab5CA in TSC2-/- MEFs, a cell line in which the loss of Rheb-GAP activity leads to constitutively elevated levels of activated, GTP-bound Rheb (Garami et al., 2003). Overexpression of Rab5CA was still able to inhibit amino acid-stimulated mTORC1/S6K1 in TSC2-/- MEFs, whereas cooverexpression of Myc-Rheb with Rab5CA in TSC2-/- MEFs blocked the inhibition of mTORC1/S6K1 signaling (Figure 2, C and D). These results suggest that Rab5CA does not act at the level of Rheb activation, but rather interferes with mTORC1-Rheb interactions.

Rab5CA Alters mTORC1 Localization and Leads to Mixing of Early and Late Endosomes
Rheb binding to mTORC1 activates mTORC1 (Patel et al., 2003; Saucedo et al., 2003; Long et al., 2005a), and this interaction has been suggested to occur on late endosomes (Sancak et al., 2008). Zerial and coworkers have shown that late endosomes arise from the conversion of early endosomes (Rink et al., 2005), a process that requires the sequential activation of Rab5, recruitment of the HOPS complex, recruitment and activation of Rab7, and inactivation and removal of Rab5. The process is disrupted by either the expression of Rab5CA or the knockdown of hVps39, a component of the HOPS complex that is a Rab7 guanine exchange factor (GEF). Both of these manipulations lead to the formation of enlarged vesicles with a mixture of early and late endosomal markers (Rink et al., 2005).
To address whether expression of Rab5CA alters mTORC1 targeting to late endosomes, we examined mTOR localization under amino acid-starved or amino-stimulated conditions in HeLa cells. As described (Sancak et al., 2008), mTOR is observed in a diffuse cytosolic staining pattern in amino acid-starved cells. After a brief amino acid stimulation, mTOR moves to a late endocytic compartment that contains LAMP-2 (Figure 3A, left-hand panels). However, in the presence of Rab5CA, mTOR is found in enlarged vesicles that contain LAMP-2 but look quite distinct from the normal mTOR localization pattern in amino acid-stimulated cells (Figure 3A, right-hand panels). A fraction of mTOR is found associated with these enlarged LAMP-positive vesicles even under amino acid-starved conditions, which is in contrast to amino acid-starved control cells, where mTOR is not found colocalized with LAMP-2. Notably, when mTOR localization was compared with that of the early endosomal marker EEA1, little to no colocalization was observed between mTOR and EEA1 in control cells (Figure 3B, left-hand panels). However, in cells expressing Rab5CA, mTOR was also found in enlarged vesicles that contain EEA1 (Figure 3B, right-hand panels). To determine whether this was due to a mixing of early and late endosomes, as opposed to a less stringent targeting of mTOR, we costained Rab5CA-expressing cells for EEA1, LAMP-2, and mTOR. Overexpression of Rab5CA leads to the formation of hybrid endosomes that contain markers for both early and late endosomes (Figure 3C). Under amino acid-stimulated conditions in Rab5CA expressing cells, mTOR is found in these hybrid endosomes (Figure 3D). These data suggest that hybrid early/late endosomes cannot support mTOR signaling.

(A) Control HeLa cells or cells transfected with Rab5CA were incubated in amino acid-free media for 50 min and then stimulated without or with 1x (final) complete amino acid solution for 10 min. Cells were fixed and immunostained for endogenous mTOR and LAMP-2 as indicated and analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Scale bars, 5 mum.

Knockdown of hVps39 Blocks Early/Late Endosome Conversion and Inhibits mTORC1 Signaling
We used an alternative approach to blocking early/late endosome conversion, by knocking down hVps39 in HeLa cells using a pool of four small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides. Knockdown was 80% efficient as determined by real time PCR (data not shown). Knockdown of hVps39 led to the formation of hybrid endosomes that were smaller than those produced by Rab5CA but still showed colocalization of EEA1 and LAMP-2 (Figure 4A). When HeLa cells were serum-starved, stimulated with insulin, and immunostained for phosphorylated ribosomal S6, the hVps39 knockdown caused a near complete inhibition of insulin-stimulated S6 phosphorylation (Figure 4, B and C). Similarly, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of S6K1 at T389 was significantly inhibited in the hVps39 knockdown cells (Figure 4, D and E). Similar to overexpression of Rab5CA, knockdown of hVps39 also led to localization of mTOR at hybrid endosomes (Figure 4F). Thus, blocking early/late endosome conversion by knockdown of hVps39 inhibits mTORC1/S6K1 signaling, suggesting that late endosomes are specifically required for mTORC1 signaling.

Dominant Negative Mutants of Rab7 and SKD1 Do Not Disrupt Early/Late Endosomal Conversion or mTOR Targeting
Given the requirement for a normal late endosomal compartment in mTORC1 signaling, it was surprising that mutants of Rab7 and SKD1, which disrupt trafficking through the late endosomal compartment (Fujita et al., 2003; Vanlandingham and Ceresa, 2009), do not inhibit mTORC1. However, we find that mTORC1 localization to late endosomes in unaffected by SKD1-EQ or Rab7DN and that these mutants do not cause early/late endosomal mixing (Supplemental Figure 5). This suggests that the composition of the late endosomal compartment, rather than its sorting functions, is required for mTORC1 signaling. This would be consistent with the hypothesis that the late endosome serves as a scaffold for mTORC1 signaling.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we have characterized the role of endocytic trafficking in mTORC1 signaling and described how blocking a particular endocytic step, the early/late endosomal transition, affects the amino acid-sensing branch of mTORC1 signaling. When early/late endosome conversion is blocked by either overexpression of Rab5CA or knockdown of hVps39, hybrid endosomes are formed that contain markers for both early and late endosomes. mTOR localizes to these hybrid endosomes under amino acid-replete conditions, but does not signal to downstream effectors. Because overexpression of Rheb, but not hyperactivation of endogenous Rheb, can rescue the inhibition of mTORC1 by Rab5CA, we infer that the localization of mTOR to these hybrid endosomes decreases the interaction of mTOR with endogenous Rheb (Figure 5).
Figure 5.
Model of endosome conversion and mTORC1 signaling. The model shows a normal early-to-late endosome conversion (left) and a mixed early/late endocytic compartment (right). In order for mTOR to be properly activated in the late endocytic compartment in control cells (left), early endosomes must first undergo endosome conversion through the normal cycling of Rab5 and Rab7 and through the action of the HOPS complex, which contains hVps39. Amino acids stimulate the localization of mTOR to late endosomes, where it is proposed to interact with Rheb (Sancak et al., 2008). If early/late endosome conversion is blocked (right), either by overexpression of Rab5CA or knockdown of hVps39, then amino acids stimulate the localization of mTOR to a mixed endocytic compartment that does not contain Rheb. Under these conditions, mTORC1 is not activated.
There is strong evidence implicating an evolutionarily conserved role for endocytic trafficking in TOR signaling. Work in D. melanogaster has linked dTOR to the endocytic system, revealing both general and specific roles for dTOR in endocytosis (Hennig et al., 2006). In mammalian cells, the Rag GTPases have been implicated in the amino acid input to mTOR signaling (Kim et al., 2008; Sancak et al., 2008). In yeast, the Rag homologues Gtr1p and Gtr2p are required for the nutrient-driven movement of amino acid permeases from endosomes to the plasma membrane (Gao and Kaiser, 2006). Furthermore, a vacuole-associated complex containing Grt2p, Ego1p, and Ego3p are required for reinitiation of proliferation after rapamycin-induced senescence (Dubouloz et al., 2005). A subsequent study linked the yeast HOPS complex to this same process (Zurita-Martinez et al., 2007). Binda et al. (2009) have recently published that in yeast, Vps39 acts as a Rag GEF whose activity contributes to TOR activation. We cannot rule out such a role for mammalian hVps39. However, if hVps39 knockdown led to a loss of Rag activation, then we would have expected to see a disruption of mTOR localization. Instead, we still observe mTOR localization to the hybrid early/late endosomes in hVps39 knockdown cells, but mTOR does not signal to S6K1. Given that Rag is required for mTOR endosomal localization (Sancak et al., 2008), this would suggest that Rag GTP loading is preserved in hVps39 knockdown cells.
Rab5 is a pivotal player in early/late endosomal conversion. Rab5 cycles between the cytosol and early endosomes, with GDP-bound Rab5 found mostly in the cytosol and GTP-bound Rab5 found predominantly on early endosomal membranes (Stenmark et al., 1994; Ullrich et al., 1994). GTP-bound Rab5 recruits numerous effector proteins that serve multiple functions in endocytic trafficking, including EEA1, which is required for homotypic early endosome fusion, and the class C Vps/HOPS complex, which recruits and activates Rab7 (Wurmser et al., 2000; Rink et al., 2005). The distinct identity and function of early versus late endosomes is in part defined by whether they contain Rab5 or Rab7 on their membranes. Thus, a key step during early/late endosomal conversion is both the recruitment of Rab7 and the extraction of Rab5 from the early endosomal membrane. Rab5CA apparently blocks early/late endosome conversion through the failure of the constitutively GTP-bound Rab5 to be extracted from the early endosomal membrane (Rink et al., 2005). Knockdown of hVps39, a member of the HOPS complex and a GEF for Rab7, also leads to a block in early/late endosomal conversion by inhibiting the recruitment and activation of Rab7. Zerial and coworkers (Rink et al., 2005) speculate that during early to late endosomal conversion, a negative feedback loop takes place, wherein recruitment and GTP-loading of Rab7 by hVps39 leads to decreased Rab5 activation, most likely through a Rab7 effector protein with GAP activity toward Rab5. This deactivation of Rab5 allows the subsequent extraction of Rab5 from endosomal membranes.
Although the precise mechanism by which the early/late endosomal conversion facilitates amino acid-stimulated mTORC1 signaling remains unclear, we suggest that blocking endosomal conversion decreases the ability of Rheb to interact with mTOR. Endogenous Rheb may be localized to late endosomes, whereas overexpression of Rheb leads to its mislocalization to other compartments (Sancak et al., 2008). This explains why overexpressed Rheb activates mTOR in the absence of amino acids; presumably the Rheb-mTOR interaction is driven by mass action in this case, and no longer requires the amino acid-stimulated movement of mTOR to late endosomes. Our Rheb overexpression data are consistent with this hypothesis, because mTOR signaling in Rab5CA-expressing cells is not rescued by constitutive hyperactivation of endogenous Rheb in TSC2-/- MEFs, but is rescued by overexpression of Rheb. These data suggest that overexpressed Rheb can interact with mTOR in the hybrid endosomes formed in Rab5CA-expressing cells, whereas endogenous Rheb cannot. Unfortunately, attempts to measure the binding of endogenous mTOR and Rheb has been unsuccessful even in control cells, and the localization of endogenous Rheb by fractionation or immunofluorescence has not yet been achieved, as has been described elsewhere (Buerger et al., 2006; Sancak et al., 2008). During the preparation of this article, a study describing the localization of GFP-Rheb to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi was published (Hanker et al., 2009). However, overexpression of Rheb activates mTORC1 signaling even in the absence of amino acid-stimulated mTORC1 translocation (Sancak et al., 2008), suggesting that the localization of GFP-Rheb may not mimic that of endogenous Rheb.
Our results indicate that some distinct characteristic of late endosomes is vital for mTORC1 signaling, presumably related to the targeting of Rheb. One key distinction between early and late endosomes is their luminal pH, with endosomes maintaining a lower intraluminal pH than early endosomes (Murphy et al., 1984; Yamashiro and Maxfield, 1987a,b). Changes in intraluminal pH can affect the recruitment and activation of membrane associated GTPases. For example, endosomal recruitment of the small GTPase Arf6 and its GEF, ARNO, is blocked by inhibition of the vacuolar ATPase and subsequent increase in intraluminal pH (Maranda et al., 2001). Similar results have been observed for betaCOP and Arf1 binding to early endosomes (Gu and Gruenberg, 2000). Another distinction between early and late endosomes is their lipid compositions. Late but not early endosomes contain the lipid lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA; Matsuo et al., 2004). LBPA helps regulate late endosomal cholesterol levels through an associated protein Alix (Chevallier et al., 2008). Late endosomal cholesterol levels are lower than in the plasma membrane or recycling compartment but higher than in the ER (Mesmin and Maxfield, 2009). GTPase association with distinct membranes depends in part on the lipid composition of the target membrane (ten Klooster and Hordijk, 2007). Future work will address whether mTORC1 requires the distinct intraluminal pH and lipid composition of late endosomes for productive interactions with Rheb and for signaling to downstream effectors.
