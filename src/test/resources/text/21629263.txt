Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) is a pluripotent cytokine promoting epithelial cell plasticity during morphogenesis and tumour progression. TGFbeta binding to type II and type I serine/threonine kinase receptors (TbetaRII and TbetaRI) causes activation of different intracellular signaling pathways. TbetaRI is associated with the ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). Here we show that TGFbeta, via TRAF6, causes Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of TbetaRI, promoting cleavage of TbetaRI by TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE), in a PKCzeta-dependent manner. The liberated intracellular domain (ICD) of TbetaRI associates with the transcriptional regulator p300 to activate genes involved in tumour cell invasiveness, such as Snail and MMP2. Moreover, TGFbeta-induced invasion of cancer cells is TACE- and PKCzeta- dependent and the TbetaRI ICD is localized in the nuclei of different kinds of tumour cells in tissue sections. Thus, our data reveal a specific role for TbetaRI in TGFbeta mediated tumour invasion.
TGFbeta can function as both a tumour suppressor and tumour promoter under different cellular contexts. Here, the cleavage product of the TGFbeta type I receptor is shown to be generated in a TGFbeta-dependent manner, and can induce the expression of genes involved in tumour cell invasion.
Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) is a cytokine which plays an important role during normal embryogenesis due to its multifunctional effects on cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and migration. In recent years TGFbeta has become recognized as a potent regulator of cellular plasticity which is a central event during embryogenesis and tumour progression. TGFbeta signals through its binding to the type II and type I serine/threonine kinase receptors (TbetaRII and TbetaRI, respectively), to cause their hetero-oligomerization which subsequently activates different intracellular signaling pathways. TbetaRI phosphorylates the latent transcription factors Smad2 and Smad3 in early endosomes, to induce complex formation with Smad4 and nuclear translocation to regulate target genes1234. TbetaRI has been found to harbour a consensus binding site for the ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 6 (TRAF6); upon TGFbeta binding TRAF6 activates the TGFbeta activated kinase 1 (TAK1)--p38 mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway56. Interestingly, TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) has recently been shown to cleave TbetaRI in its extracellular domain, which was demonstrated to cause a loss of TGFbeta-induced inhibition of proliferation of cells7.
Posttranslational modifications of proteins, such as monoubiquitination or Lys63-linked polyubiquitination, have emerged as an important mechanism to control the localization or function of the protein, whereas Lys48-linked polyubiquitination of proteins instead targets its substrate for proteasomal degradation89. TRAF6 is known to induce Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of its substrates, including TAK15.
The underlying molecular mechanisms for how TGFbeta can both act as a tumour suppressor and a promoter remain to be fully understood. To further address how TGFbeta promotes tumour progression, we have investigated the possibility that TRAF6 regulates the subcellular localization of TbetaRI by Lys63-dependent polyubiquitination and whether this is related to the capability of TGFbeta to facilitate tumour invasion. We report here that TGFbeta uses TRAF6, PKCzeta and TACE to promote the formation of an intracellular domain (ICD) of the TbetaRI that is translocated to the nucleus, where it promotes tumour invasion by induction of Snail and MMP2.
Results
Nuclear accumulation of the intracellular domain of TbetaRI
To investigate whether TbetaRI is proteolytically cleaved in human prostate cancer (PC-3U) cells, we ectopically expressed a C-terminally tagged constitutively active (ca) TbetaRI (HA-ALK5TD). Notably, in addition to the full length receptor, the HA antibody recognized a smaller fragment, corresponding to the estimated size of the intracellular part of TbetaRI (Supplementary Fig. S1a). Using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, we next investigated the subcellular localization of endogenous TbetaRI in PC-3U cells visualized by a antibodies raised against its intracellular, C-terminal part (V22) or its extracellular N-terminal part (H100; Fig. 1a). An enhanced nuclear accumulation of TbetaRI, or its C-terminal fragment, was noticed in TGFbeta-stimulated PC-3U cells, upon staining with the V22 antibody. In contrast, immunofluorescence staining revealed that the extracellular domain of the receptor, visualized by the H100-antibody was mainly localized in the cell membrane in PC-3U cells stimulated with TGFbeta for 6 h (Fig. 1a). To ensure the specificity of the V22 antibody in immunofluorescence and immunoblotting, siRNA was used to knock-down endogenous TbetaRI expression in PC-3U cells (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S1b); qRT-PCR was also used to demonstrate a substantial decrease of TbetaRI mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig. S1b). The specificity of the V22 antibody used in our study was also verified by peptide blocking (Supplementary Fig. S1c).
To further validate the observation that TbetaRI, or its intracellular domain (ICD), is translocated to the nucleus in a TGFbeta-dependent manner, we performed a nuclear fractionation assay of cell lysates from TGFbeta-treated PC-3U cells. Immunoblotting of nuclear extracts by the V22 antibody revealed a TbetaRI fragment of approximally 34 kDa, which was not recognized by the H100 antibody raised against the N-terminal part of TbetaRI (Fig. 1b). In contrast, full-length TbetaRI was observed in the cytoplasmic fraction, both by the V22 and H100 antibodies (Fig. 1b). While a pronounced increase of nuclear TbetaRI was detected by immunofluorescence only after TGFbeta stimulation (Fig. 1a), nuclear TbetaRI was detected by immunoblotting also in the absence of TGFbeta stimulation (Fig. 1b). This discrepancy is probably due to the fact that sensitivity for detection of nuclear TbetaRI is higher with the nuclear fractionation assay. To further investigate the TGFbeta-dependency of nuclear accumulation of TbetaRI, we expressed a fusion protein in which GFP was linked to the C-terminal part of TbetaRI in PC-3U cells. The GFP-tagged TbetaRI entered the nucleus of PC-3U cells after stimulation with TGFbeta for 6 h, while GFP expressed from a vector containing GFP alone did not (Fig. 1c). We also investigated the nuclear localization of ectopically expressed C-terminally HA-tagged ca TbetaRI in PC-3U cells and observed a TGFbeta-induced accumulation of the HA-tagged ca TbetaRI-ICD (Supplementary Fig. S1d). This observation is consistent with the nuclear accumulation of endogenous TbetaRI-ICD as shown in Figure 1a,b. In further support of the notion that the N-terminal part of the TbetaRI did not enter the nucleus, a HA-tagged TbetaRI with the tag localized N-terminally between amino acid residues 27 and 284, was found not to enter the nucleus in PC-3U cells with or without treatment with TGFbeta (Supplementary Fig. S1e). Moreover, no TGFbeta-induced increase of the TbetaRI-ICD for N-terminal HA-tagged TbetaRI was observed (Supplementary Fig. S1f). Together, these results suggest that the ICD of TbetaRI enters into the nucleus in PC-3U cells in response to TGFbeta stimulation.
Nuclear accumulation of TbetaRI is dependent on TRAF6
We have recently identified a consensus binding site for TRAF6 in TbetaRI5. Ligand-induced oligomerization of the TGFbeta receptor complex results in receptor kinase-independent activation of the enzymatic activity of TRAF6. This in turn causes Lys63-polyubiquitin-dependent activation of TGFbeta-activated kinase-1 (TAK1), causing activation of p38 MAPK in PC-3U cells. In contrast, activation of the canonical Smad pathway does not require TRAF65. To examine whether TRAF6 is important for the cleavage and nuclear accumulation of TbetaRI, we expressed C-terminally HA-tagged wild-type (wt) caTbetaRI (HA-TbetaRI) or the HA-tagged caE161A (HA-E161A) receptor mutant which is unable to bind TRAF6, but still causes activation of the canonical Smad signalling pathway5. As shown in Figure 2a, stimulation of cells with TGFbeta resulted in Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of wt TbetaRI, but not of the E161A mutant TbetaRI. Cleavage of the wt TbetaRI, as observed by immunoblotting of total cell lysate with HA antiserum was found to associate with its Lys63-linked polyubiquitination (Fig. 2a). Moreover, the E161A mutant TbetaRI failed to activate the p38 MAPK pathway while it was still able to activate Smad2, consistent with our previous report5 (Fig. 2a). In addition, knock-down of endogenous TRAF6 in PC-3U cells by siRNA, also resulted in loss of Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of TbetaRI, as well as loss of the formation of the TbetaRI ICD in response to stimulation with TGFbeta (Supplementary Fig. S2a,b). By using either Lys63 or Lys48 polyubiquitin-specific antibodies, we found that wt TbetaRI was Lys63-polyubiquitinated after 30 min of TGFbeta stimulation, while no obvious sign of TGFbeta-induced Lys48-polyubiqutination of TbetaRI, was observed in this cell line during this time course (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. S2a,c).
The pattern of polyubiquitination of TbetaRI was further examined using HA-tagged wt or mutant ubiquitin overexpressed in PC-3U cells. TGFbeta stimulation induced polyubiquitination of TbetaRI in PC-3U cells transiently transfected with a ubiquitin mutant in which all lysine residues where mutated except Lys63, while reduced ubiquitination was seen when a similar mutant retaining only Lys48 was expressed (Fig. 2b). In addition, TRAF6 was shown to induce the polyubiquitination of TbetaRI in an in vitro ubiquitination assay, providing firm evidence that TbetaRI is a substrate for TRAF6 (Supplementary Fig. S3).
TGFbeta-induced nuclear accumulation of ectopically expressed C-terminal HA-tagged caTbetaRI in PC-3U cells occurred more efficiently for the wt TbetaRI than for the E161A mutant HA-TbetaRI, as analyzed by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2c). On the basis of these data, we conclude that TRAF6 causes Lys63-dependent polyubiquitination of TbetaRI in a TGFbeta-dependent manner which correlates with generation of an intracellular fragment of TbetaRI and its nuclear accumulation.
TbetaRI is cleaved by TACE
The metalloproteases TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE)/ADAM17 and ADAM10, when activated, cleave certain receptors and adhesion proteins, just outside the cell membrane. TACE has recently been shown to cleave TbetaRI in an ERK MAP-kinase dependent manner, leading to desensitization of TGFbeta signaling7. TACE is often overexpressed in tumours and is activated by PKC10. To further characterize the molecular mechanisms behind the cleavage and nuclear translocation of TbetaRI, we examined the possible involvement of the metalloproteinase TACE/ADAM17. Treatment of human PC-3U cells with TPA to activate PKC10 led to nuclear accumulation of endogenous TbetaRI or its ICD, as shown by immunofluorescence (Fig. 3a). Moreover, when PC-3U cells expressing the C-terminally tagged HA-caTbetaRI were treated with TGFbeta or TPA, the ICD accumulated in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 3b). Pretreatment of cells with TAPI-2, an inhibitor of TACE, led to a decreased nuclear entrance of the ICD of endogenous TbetaRI in response to TGFbeta stimulation (Fig. 3c,d). As TACE was shown recently to associate with the ectopically expressed TbetaRI in cells expressing HER211, we investigated by co-immunofluorescence if endogenous TbetaRI associated with TACE in PC-3U cells. A TGFbeta-induced colocalization of TbetaRI and TACE was observed (Fig. 3e). From these data, we conclude that activation of TACE, either by TPA-treatment of cells or stimulation with TGFbeta, leads to accumulation of the TbetaRI ICD in the nucleus.
Determination of the TACE cleavage site in TbetaRI
Previous studies have shown that TACE has a strong preference for cleavage at Ala-Val sequences12 or Gly-Leu sequences13. TbetaRI contains two Gly-Leu sequences, located at position Gly52 and Gly120. To investigate the possibility that TACE cleaves TbetaRI at Gly120, which is located close to the transmembrane domain, we mutated Gly 120 to Ile (G120I) in TbetaRI. The G120I mutant TbetaRI did not undergo cleavage in response to TGFbeta stimulation (Fig. 4a), suggesting that TACE cleaves TbetaRI at the Gly-Leu bond at position 120-121. The kinase activity of the G120I mutant was intact as judged by its ability to phosphorylate Smad2, when compared with wt TbetaRI. Moreover, the G120I mutant TbetaRI did not accumulate in the nucleus in response to TGFbeta stimulation (Fig. 4b).
PKCzeta is needed for TACE-induced cleavage of TbetaRI
We next investigated whether PKCzeta, which is the only member in the PKC-family known to form a multiprotein-complex with TRAF614, is involved in cleavage of TbetaRI and nuclear translocation of the ICD. Inhibition of PKCzeta, by PKCzeta pseudosubstrate, completely prevented nuclear accumulation of the TbetaRI ICD in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. S4a). It is well accepted that the classical members of the PKC family are activated by TPA, while atypic PKC isoforms like PKCzeta are thought not to be activated by TPA1516. However, we found that PKCzeta is activated as a result of stimulation of cells by TGFbeta, as well as by TPA (Fig. 5b). TGFbeta stimulation did not lead to activation of PKCzeta in TRAF6-/- MEFs (Fig. 5c), supporting the notion that TRAF6 is important for TGFbeta-induced activation of PKCzeta. Using a nuclear fractionation assay, we noticed a significant loss of TGFbeta-induced nuclear accumulation of TbetaRI ICD after siRNA-mediated silencing of PKCzeta (Fig. 5d). In addition, ectopic expression of wt PKCzeta promoted expression and cleavage of caTbetaRI or kinase dead (KD) TbetaRI mutant (Fig. 5e). Treatment of PC-3U cells with the PKCzeta inhibitor decreased the formation of the ICD of C-terminally HA-tagged ca TbetaRI in TGFbeta-treated cells as well as in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S4b,c), while treatment with the TbetaRI kinase inhibitor SB505124 had no major effect (Fig. 5f).
Using immunofluorescence stainings, we observed TGFbeta-induced co-localization of endogenous TbetaRI and TACE. Adding the PKCzeta pseudosubstrate to cells prevented the co-localization (Fig. 5g), suggesting that PKCzeta activity is needed for a proper localization of TbetaRI to a subcellular compartment where it can be cleaved by TACE. In conclusion, TGFbeta causes activation of PKCzeta in a TRAF6-dependent manner, which is important for the proteolytic cleavage of the TbetaRI by TACE, leading to nuclear accumulation of TbetaRI ICD.
TbetaRI ICD regulates transcription
The observation that the ICD of TbetaRI enters the nucleus in TGFbeta-treated PC-3U cells, suggests that it might participitate in gene regulation. To search for a link between the nuclear TbetaRI ICD and gene transcription, we investigated if TbetaRI ICD associates with the well-known transcriptional regulator p300. TGFbeta treatment of PC-3U cells led to a co-localization of TbetaRI and p300 in nuclear specles (Fig. 6a), which we identified by co-immunofluorescence as promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies17 (Fig. 6b). Treatment of cells with the PKCzeta pseudosubstrate prevented the co-localization of TbetaRI with PML nuclear bodies (Fig. 6b). By co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the acetyltransferase p300 was found to associate with TbetaRI ICD in vivo (Fig. 6c,d) and we used an acetyl-lysine antibody to verify that TbetaRI ICD is acetylated (Fig. 6e). In contrast, in cells expressing the E161A mutant TbetaRI, less ICD was associated with endogenous p300 and less acetylated ICD was detected (Fig. 6d,e). We observed that the level of p300 was lower in cells transfected with the E161A mutant TbetaRI unable to bind TRAF6, compared to wt TbetaRI (Fig. 6d). Using qRT-PCR, a TGFbeta-induced increase of p300 mRNA expression was observed in cells transiently transfected with wt TbetaRI, but not in cells transfected with E161A mutant TbetaRI (Fig. 6f). This suggests that TGFbeta induces p300 in a TRAF6-dependent manner.
Next, we used qRT-PCR to analyze the effect of TbetaRI ICD on known TGFbeta target genes. Snail and MMP2 mRNA expressions were induced by wt TbetaRI but much less by the E161A mutant TbetaRI, whereas PAI1 and Smad7 were induced by both wt and E161A mutant TbetaRI (Fig. 6g). A chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed binding of TbetaRI or TbetaRI ICD to the endogenous Snail promoter in a TGFbeta-dependent manner in PC-3U cells (Fig. 6h). Since expression of Snail and MMP2 genes is linked to tumour invasiveness18, we examined PC-3U cells expressing wt or E161A mutant TbetaRI using an invasion assay. Interestingly, we observed that TGFbeta-induced invasion occurred in PC-3U cells only when wt TbetaRI was expressed, whereas epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulated invasion both in cells expressing wt or mutant TbetaRI (Fig. 6i, right panel shows optical density (OD) mean values of stained invasive tumour cells). Similar results were observed when the experiment was repeated using the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP; TGFbeta treatment of LNCaP cells expressing wt TbetaRI, but not the E161A mutant TbetaRI, promoted their invasion (Supplementary Fig. S5a,b). Thus, our data propose that the TbetaRI ICD associates with p300 in nuclear PML bodies in a PKCzeta-dependent manner, and is acetylated by p300. Moreover, Snail and MMP2 are induced by TbetaRI ICD, correlating with an increased invasiveness of cells.
Nuclear TbetaRI ICD is observed in malignant prostate cells
We observed that the nuclear entrance of TbetaRI was associated with invasiveness of prostate cancer cells; therefore, we used immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy to investigate the subcellular localization of endogenous TbetaRI, in primary human prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) cells and PC-3U cells, visualized by the V22 antibody raised against its C-terminal part (Fig. 6j,k). Intriguingly, accumulation of TbetaRI or its ICD in the nucleus took place in malignant PC-3U cells, but not in normal PrEC cells, where TbetaRI was retained in cell-cell contacts, also after treatment with TGFbeta.
Nuclear TbetaRI ICD is linked to TGFbeta-induced cancer invasion
To explore the generality of the TGFbeta-induced pathway identified in this report, we extended our investigation to the human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231 and the human lung carcinoma cell line A549. By using confocal imaging, we found that TGFbeta treatment of MDA-MB-231 also promotes accumulation of endogenous ICD of TbetaRI in the nucleus, in a TACE- and PKCzeta- dependent manner, which was found to be associated with the TGFbeta-induced invasiveness of the cells (Fig. 7a,b). We observed a similar association between TGFbeta-induced nuclear accumulation of TbetaRI ICD and TGFbeta-induced invasiveness in the A549 cell line, which also in these cancer cells were regulated by TACE and PKCzeta (Fig. 7c,d). From these data we conclude that TGFbeta-induced invasion of human breast and lung cancer cells correlates with nuclear accumulation of TbetaRI in a TACE- and PKCzeta-dependent manner.
Nuclear TbetaRI ICD is observed in human tumours in vivo
To explore whether nuclear accumulation of the TbetaRI ICD occurs in human tumours, we used immunohistochemistry to investigate the expression and localization of TbetaRI in a panel of prostate cancers, renal cell carcinomas and bladder tumours. Nuclear accumulation of TbetaRI ICD was observed in 19 of 19 investigated prostate cancer tissues, in 19 of 24 renal cell carcinomas, and in 21 of 23 bladder tumours, while staining with the H100 antibody to visualize the extracellular part of TbetaRI, showed staining only in the cytoplasm (Fig. 8). No immunohistochemical staining of TbetaRI was observed in control experiment (when the primary antibodies were omitted, Supplementary Fig. S6). Thus, our data demonstrated that nuclear accumulation of TbetaRI ICD is observed in human tumours.
Discussion
We have provided evidence that TbetaRI undergoes cleavage by TACE in cancer cells and that the ICD of TbetaRI is translocated to the nucleus where it associates with the transcriptional regulator p300 in nuclear PML bodies. Accumulation of the ICD of TbetaRI in the nucleus occurs after TGFbeta stimulation and is dependent on TRAF6, TACE and PKCzeta. The expression levels of Smads did not influence the PKCzeta-dependent generation of the ICD of TbetaRI as knock down of Smad4 by siRNA, had no effect on the PKCzeta-induced generation of TbetaRI ICD (Supplementary Fig. S7a). Neither did overexpression of Smad2, 3 or 4 in PC-3U cells affect PKCzeta-induced generation of TbetaRI ICD (Supplementary Fig. S7b). Since the TRAF6-binding deficient TbetaRI mutant (HA-E161A) still activates Smad2, while generation of the TbetaRI ICD is impaired, it appears that the canonical Smad pathway can operate independently of the generation of the TbetaRI ICD, which instead correlates with activation of the TRAF6--TAK1--p38 MAPK pathway (Fig. 2a).
Integrins are essential adhesion receptors which are involved in cell migration and extracelullar matrix assembly19. TGFbeta-induced activation of the p38 MAPK pathway has been demonstrated to be related to integrin signaling and implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition in certain cell lines20. To investigate a possible relationship between integrin signaling and TGFbeta-induced generation of TbetaRI ICD, we used antibodies which promotes or inhibits integrin activation21 (TS2 and CD29 antibodies, respectively). No major effects on TGFbeta-induced formation of the TbetaRI ICD was observed, when integrins were activated or inhibited (Supplementary Fig. S8).
Exactly how TbetaRI ICD is translocated to the nucleus is the topic of our ongoing investigations. Interestingly, our finding that the ICD of TbetaRI associates with p300 and the Snail promoter, to support transcriptional regulation of a subset of genes, including Snail, MMP2 and p300, correlates with increased invasiveness of cells. Whether the Smad proteins also participitate in the transcriptional complexes is an interesting possibility that remains to be elucidated. Nuclear accumulation of TbetaRI was observed in prostate, breast and lung cancer cells and also in several cancer tissues, but not in primary prostate epithelial cells. Thus the pathway elucidated in this report occurs in different kinds of human tumours and could contribute to tumour progression. Taken together, our data support the notion that the cleavage and nuclear accumulation of TbetaRI is part of a tumour promoting TGFbeta signaling pathway.
Methods

All inhibitors were added 1 h before TGFbeta stimulation.
Protein analyses
The cells were starved for 12-18 h and then stimulated with TGFbeta for indicated time periods, washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.5% (v/v) DOC, 1% (v/v) NP40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM aprotinin, 1 mM Pefabloc and 2 mM sodium orthovanadate). After centrifugation, supernatants were collected and protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein measurement kit (Nordic Biolabs). Equal amount of protein from total cell lysate and immunoprecipitation were run in SDS-PAGE using 6, 10, 12 or 4-12% gradient polyacrylamide gels, blotted on to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes and subjected to immunoblotting, as previously described25. In vitro and in vivo ubiquitination assays, immunofluorescence and transient transfections were performed, as previously described52627. HA, TACE, H100 and V22 antibodies were diluted 1:50 when used for immunofluorescence. Photo micrographs were obtained by Zeiss 510 Meta (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc.) with a digital camera (RET-EXi-F-M-12-C) from Q-imaging.
Nuclear fractionation assays
Two different protocols for nuclear fractionation were used to examine TbetaRI accumulation in the nucleus in response to TGFbeta.
The first used for cell fractionation, has earlier been described27 and was used in the experiments shown in Figures 1b and 5d.
The second was applied in experiments shown in Figure 3b and used Nuclear Complex Co-IP kit purchased from Active Motif. Cells in a 10-cm dish were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and then scraped and collected into 1 ml ice-cold PBS; after centrifugation at 1,500 r.p.m. for 5 min at 4 degreesC, the cell pellet was gently resuspended in 500 mul Hypotonic Buffer and incubated on ice for 15 min. Twenty five mul of Detergent Solution was added and gently mixed and centrifuged at 14,000xg for 30 s, at 4 degreesC. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 100 mul Complete Digestion Buffer, vortexed gently for 2 s after adding 0.5 mul of Enzymatic Shearing Cocktail, thereafter incubated for 10 min at 37 degreesC. The nuclear lysates were vortexed gently after 2 mul of 0.5 M EDTA had been added to stop the reaction, and then incubated on ice for 5 min, centrifuged (14,000g, 10 min, 4 degreesC), and the supernatant was collected for immunoprecipitation.
Invasion assay
Invasion assays were performed by using the CytoSelect(TM) Cell Invasion Assay (Cell Biolabs, Inc., San Diego, CA). The basement membrane layer of the cell culture inserts were rehydrated in 300 mul serum-free RPMI-1640, and 2x106 cells were seeded into the upper area of the chambers in serum-free RPMI-1640 with or without TGFbeta. Lower wells of the invasion plates were filled with 500 mul RPMI, supplemented with 10% FBS. Non-invasive cells were removed from the upper chamber and invasive cells were photographed by a Leica DMR light microscope, after staining with crystal violet cell stain solution. Colorimetric quantification was performed by transfer inserts into 200 mul of extraction solution for 10 min. Optical density (O.D.) at 560 nm was determined for extracts transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate using a plate reader.
Plasmids and DNA transfections
GFP-caTbetaRI was constructed by cloning full length caTbetaRI between the immediate early promoter of CMV and the EGFP coding sequence; the C-terminus of caTbetaRI was fused to the N-terminus of pEGFP-N3 vector.
