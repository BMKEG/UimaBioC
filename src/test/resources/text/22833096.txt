Although previous studies have proposed plausible mechanisms of the activation of transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) in inflammatory signals, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), its activating kinase still remains to be unclear. In the present study, we have provided evidences that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-alpha1 has a pivotal role for activating TAK1, and thereby regulate NF-kappaB-dependent gene expressions in inflammatory signaling mediated by TLR4 and TNF-alpha stimulation. AMPK-alpha1 specifically interacts with TAK1 and reciprocally regulates their kinase activities. Upon the stimulation of lipopolysaccharide, AMPK-alpha1-knockdown (AMPK-alpha1KD) or TAK1-knockdown human monocytic THP-1 cells exhibit a dramatic reduction in the TAK1 or AMPK-alpha1 kinase activity, respectively, and subsequent suppressions of its downstream signaling cascades, which further leads to inhibitions of NF-kappaB and thereby productions of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6. Importantly, the microarray analysis of AMPK-alpha1KD cells revealed a dramatic reduction in the NF-kappaB-dependent genes induced by TLR4 and TNF-alpha stimulation, and the observation was in significant correlation with the results of quantitative real-time PCR. Moreover, AMPK-alpha1KD cells are highly sensitive to the TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis, which is accompanied with dramatic reductions in the NF-kappaB-dependent and anti-apoptotic genes. As a result, our data demonstrate that AMPK-alpha1 as an activating kinase of TAK1 has a key role in mediating inflammatory signals triggered by TLR4 and TNF-alpha.
AMP-activated protein kinase-alpha1 TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 NF-kappaB Toll-like receptor 4 TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis
Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family and a serine/threonine protein kinase.1, 2, 3, 4 TAK1 functions as an upstream signaling molecule of NF-kappaB and MAPKs in proinflammatory signals transduced by TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands.5, 6 Binding of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to TLR4 causes recruitment of MyD88, IRAK, and TRAF6 to the receptor.7, 8 The TRAF6 catalyzes synthesis of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains that serve as a scaffold to recruit the TAK1 and IkappaB kinase (IKK) complexes. Recruitment of the kinase complexes facilitates autophosphorylation of TAK1 and subsequent phosphorylation of IKKbeta by TAK1, leading to IkappaB degradation and subsequent activation of NF-kappaB.5, 6 Despite of the plausible mechanisms by which TAK1 is activated,6 the existence of a specific upstream kinase of TAK1 in the signaling cascades is still ambiguous.
The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that has emerged as a master sensor of cellular energy balance in mammalian cells.9, 10 The AMPK protein exists as a heterotrimer composed of a 63-kDa catalytic (alpha) subunit and two non-catalytic regulatory subunits, beta (30 kDa) and gamma (38-63 kDa). There are several isoforms for each of the three AMPK subunits, including alpha1, alpha2, beta1, beta2, gamma1, gamma2, and gamma3.11, 12 The two AMPKalpha variants, alpha1 and alpha2, have been shown to have a differential localization pattern in mammalian cells, with the AMPK-alpha1 subunit being localized in the cytoplasm, whereas the AMPK-alpha2 subunit localized in the nucleus.13, 14 In terms of cell type specificity, most of the cells express both AMPK-alpha1 and AMPK-alpha2 isoforms, whereas lymphcytes only express the AMPK-alpha1 isoform.15, 16 A previous report has addressed the relationship between T-cell receptor-mediated signaling and AMPK-alpha1 through Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKK)-dependent pathway, implying that AMPK-alpha1 may have specific roles in immune cells.15
Here, we demonstrate that AMPK-alpha1 has a pivotal role in inducing proinflammatory signals, such as TLR4 and TNF-alpha, through the activation of TAK1. The knockdown of AMPK-alpha1 results in the marked reduction of TAK1 activity, and thereby suppressions of downstream signaling cascades and the expression of NF-kappaB-dependent genes in response to LPS stimulation, indicating an AMPK-alpha1-TAK1-NF-kappaB axis in TLR4-mediated signaling. Moreover, AMPK-alpha1-knockdown cells are highly sensitive to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis, supporting the functional role of AMPK-alpha1 associated with expressions of anti-apoptotic genes regulated by the TAK1-induced NF-kappaB activity. Thus, our results suggest that AMPK-alpha1 may be one of the upstream kinases capable of inducing the activation of TAK1 in proinflammatory signals.
Results
Inhibition of AMPK- alpha 1 activity attenuates TLR4-mediated signaling pathway
Previous reports have demonstrated the functional relationship between AMPK and TAK1;17, 18, 19, 20 however, the functional role of AMPK-alpha1 has not yet been elucidated in innate signal. Therefore, we have explored this issue in human monocytic THP-1 cells with a TLR4 agonist, LPS. To know whether LPS stimulation induces the activation of AMPK-alpha1, because it has been known that AMPK-alpha1, but not AMPK-alpha2, is solely expressed in human monocytic cells,16 THP-1 cells were treated with LPS for different time intervals and then the activation of AMPK-alpha1 was evaluated with anti-pho-AMPK antibody. The phosphorylation of AMPK-alpha1 was gradually increased by LPS treatment in a time-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure 1). To further examine whether AMPK-alpha1 is either a positive or negative regulator in the TLR4-mediated signaling pathway, leading to activate NF-kappaB and activator protein 1 (AP-1), THP-1 cells were stimulated with LPS in the presence or absence of different concentrations of compound C, which is a pharmacological inhibitor of AMPK.21 Both NF-kappaB and AP-1 reporter activities induced by LPS were significantly reduced in compound C-treated THP-1 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1a, NF-kappaB; Figure 1b, AP-1). Furthermore, the inhibition of AMPK-alpha1 activity resulted in a dramatic reduction in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta, induced by LPS (Figure 1c, IL-6; Figure 1d, TNF-alpha; Figure 1e, IL-1beta). We next attempted to verify the specific function of AMPK-alpha1 in terms of its kinase activity. For this, we constructed dominant negative (DN), AMPK-alpha1 (D159A), and constitutive active (CA), AMPK-alpha1 (T174D), forms of AMPK-alpha1, and examined their functional roles (Figure 1f). Overexpression of wild-type (wt) AMPK-alpha1 slightly enhanced the activities of both, NF-kappaB and AP-1, in the presence or absence of LPS stimulations (Figures 1g and h, closed bar), whereas AMPK-alpha1 (D159A) DN significantly suppressed these activities (Figures 1g and h, chute-block bar). In contrast, AMPK-alpha1 (T174D) CA induced increase in the activities of NF-kappaB and AP-1 (Figures 1g and h, hatched bar). Consistent with the above-mentioned findings, similar results in the production of inflammatory cytokines were observed (Figure 1i, TNF-alpha; Figure 1j, IL-6; Figure 1k, IL-1beta). These results suggest that AMPK-alpha1 may be positively involved in TLR4-mediated signaling pathway.
The autoinhibitory domain of AMPK-alpha1 interacts with N-terminus of TAK1, and that reciprocally regulate their activations
We next explored the molecular mechanism by which AMPK-alpha1 is involved in TLR4-mediated signaling. Previous reports have shown that TAK1 is involved in the activation of AMPK.17, 18, 19, 20 We raised a possibility of the functional regulation between TAK1 and AMPK-alpha1 serine/threonine protein kinase. We first tested the molecular interaction between AMPK-alpha1 and TAK1. The overexpressed TAK1 was significantly co-immunoprecipitated with overexpressed AMPK-alpha1, and the interaction was enhanced by LPS stimulation (Figure 2a, lane 4 versus lane 5). To identify the interaction domain in each other, TAK1 or AMPK-alpha1 truncated mutants were constructed (Supplementary Figure 2), and then immunoprecipitation assay was performed. Overexpressed AMPK-alpha1 was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with all the truncated TAK1 construct, indicating that AMPK-alpha1 interacts with TAK1 through the N-terminus of TAK1 (Figure 2b). In addition, TAK1 specifically interacted with the autoinhibitory domain of AMPK-alpha1, AMPK-alpha1 (312-392) (Figure 2c). To verify the in vitro interaction, we further performed endogenous immunoprecipication assay. Consistent with in vitro interaction, endogenous TAK1 was specifically coprecipitated with endogenous AMPK-alpha1, and the interaction was significantly enhanced in response to LPS stimulation (Figure 2d, lane 1 versus lane 2). These results suggest that the autoinhibitory domain of AMPK-alpha1 interacts with the N-terminus of TAK1 (Figure 2e). We next explored whether AMPK-alpha1 is directly able to activate TAK1 in response to LPS stimulation. To find an answer for our query, we generated knockdown THP-1 cells against AMPK-alpha1 and TAK1 protein by using siRNA-contained lentiviruses (Supplementary Figure 3 and Figure 2f). Interestingly, phosphorylations of Thr172/174 and Ser 485 of APK-alpha1 were markedly reduced and the phosphorylation of TAK1 was dramatically reduced in AMPK-alpha1-knockdown (AMPK-alpha1KD) THP-1 cells treated with LPS as compared with that of wt THP-1 cells (Figure 2f, AMPK-alpha1KD). Interestingly, TAK1-knockdown (TAK1KD) cells exhibited marked reduction in phosphorylation of Thr172/174 and Ser 485 of AMPK-alpha1 in response to LPS stimulation (Figure 2f, TAK1KD). It was partly consistent with the previous report that TAK1 is involved in the activation of AMPK-alpha1.17 Consistent with the result, the kinase activity of TAK1 or AMPK-alpha1 induced by LPS stimulation was also significantly reduced in AMPK-alpha1KD or TAK1KD THP-1 cells, respectively, as compared with that of wt THP-1 cells (Figure 2g, TAK1; Figure 2h, AMPK-alpha1). These results strongly demonstrate that the autoinhibitory domain of AMPK-alpha1 interacts with N-terminus of TAK1, which further reciprocally regulates their kinase activities (Figure 2e).
AMPK- alpha 1-knockdown THP-1 cells exhibit the impairments of TLR4-mediated signaling pathway
To understand the functional role played by AMPK-alpha1 in TLR4-mediated signaling pathway, biochemical studies were performed in AMPK-alpha1KD THP-1 cells. Basal activities of NF-kappaB and AP-1 were significantly decreased in AMPK-alpha1KD THP-1 cells, as compared with that of wt THP-1 cells (Figures 3a and b, closed bars). Their activity were markedly increased in LPS-treated wt THP-1 cells (Figures 3a and b, doted bars), moreover, significantly enhanced in wt-AMPK-alpha1-expressed wt THP-1 stimulated with LPS, as compared with that of unstimulated wt THP-1 cells (Figures 3a and b, chute-block bar). To gain further direct evidence on whether AMPK-alpha1 is involved in the TLR4-mediated signal, we performed the rescue experiment in AMPK-alpha1KD THP-1 cells. The wt AMPK-alpha1 vector was transfected in the AMPK-alpha1KD THP-1 cells. The AMPK-alpha1KD THP-1 cells transfected with AMPK-alpha1 vector were treated with or without LPS. Interestingly, the activities of NF-kappaB and AP-1 were markedly recovered, as compared with that of mock transfectant AMPK-alpha1KD THP-1 cells treated with LPS (Figures 3a and b in AMPK-alpha1KD, dotted bar versus chute-block bar). Given these results, we further assessed DNA-binding activities of NF-kappaB, p65 and p50, and AP-1, c-fos and c-jun. Consistently, overexpressions of AMPK-alpha1 in wt THP-1 markedly enhanced DNA-binding activities of p65, p50, c-fos, and c-jun (Figure 3c, p65; Figure 3d, p50; Figure 3e, c-fos; Figure 3f, c-jun). Furthermore, these DNA-binding activities were significantly increased in AMPK-alpha1-transfected AMPK-alpha1KD THP-1 cells (Figure 3c, p65; Figure 3d, p50; Figure 3e, c-fos; Figure 3f, c-jun), indicating a positive role of AMPK-alpha1 in TLR4-mediated signaling. Based on the functional role of AMPK-alpha1 in TLR4-mediated activations of NF-kappaB and AP-1, we next assessed regulations of signaling molecules, which appear in the TLR4-mediated signaling cascades. For this, wt THP-1 and AMPK-alpha1KD THP-1 cells were treated with or without LPS for different times. As expected, the phosphorylation of TAK1 was markedly attenuated in AMPK-alpha1KD THP-1 cells, as compared with that of wt THP-1 cells (Figure 3g, pho-TAK1). Interestingly, phosphorylations of other downstream signaling molecules, such as p-38, JNK, and AKT, were also significantly decreased in AMPK-alpha1KD THP-1 cells (Figure 3g). These results were partly consistent with previous reports that AMPK has an important role in promoting activations of p38 MAPK, JNK, and AKT.22, 23, 24 Moreover, we found that a marked reduction of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6, induced by LPS stimulation could be detected in AMPK-alpha1KD THP-1 cells, as compared with that of wt THP-1 cells (Figure 3h). These results provide evidence on the positive role of AMPK-alpha1 in TLR4-mediated signaling pathway through the activation of TAK1.
AMPK- alpha 1-knockdown THP-1 cells exhibit the impairments of expression of NF-kappaB-dependent genes induced by TLR4
To validate the axis of AMPK-alpha1-TAK1-NF-kappaB in TLR4-mediated signaling pathway in a detailed manner, we performed gene expression analysis. According to stimulation of LPS, marked changes in gene expression profiles could be detected (Supplementary Figure 4). To assess the NF-kappaB-dependent gene expressions by LPS stimulation, 94 genes containing specific kappaB-binding DNA sequences were further sorted out. Expression levels of 94 genes were significantly altered in either wt or AMPK-alpha1KD THP-1 cells by treatment with or without LPS (Figure 4a). According to the relative up and down expressions in each combination, 36 genes were selected, and were subdivided into two groups: group 1, highly regulated genes such as IL-1beta, IL-8, CD44, TNF-alpha, and CCL-5; and group 2, moderately regulated genes such as NF-KB1, NF-KB1A, NF-KB1E, RELB, IER3, REL, and BCL3 (Figure 4b, Supplementary Table 1a, and Supplementary Table 1b). To verify their expression, we performed quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis with specific primers targeted to each gene. Both group 1 and group 2 genes were greatly upregulated in LPS-treated wt THP-1 cells, as compared with that of without stimulation, whereas minute changes could be detected in LPS-treated AMPK-alpha1KD THP-1 cells, as compared with that of without stimulation (Figure 4c, group 1 gene; Figure 4d, group 2 gene). These results strongly support that AMPK-alpha1 is positively involved in the TLR4-mediated signaling pathway through the activation of TAK1, and thereby regulates TLR4-mediated NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression.
AMPK- alpha 1 is functionally involved in TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis through the regulation of NF-kappaB-dependent genes
Previous studies have shown that TAK1 has a protective role against TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis through the activation of NF-kappaB.3, 4 In addition, a recent report has shown that AMPK confers protection against TNF-alpha-induced cardiac cell death.25 Based on these previous reports and our above results, we assumed that, if AMPK-alpha1 has a key role in the activation of TAK1, and thereby regulates the expression of NF-kappaB-dependent genes, the defectiveness of AMPK-alpha1 might be critically affected on TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. As expected, apoptotic cell death induced by TNF-alpha was markedly increased in TAK1-/-MEF cells (Figures 5a and b, 9+/-2% in mock without TNF-alpha versus 23+/-4% in mock with TNF-alpha), whereas the apoptosis was significantly decreased in TAK1-overexpressed TAK1-/-MEF cells than in the case of mock transfectants (Figure 5b, 23+/-4% in mock with TNF-alpha versus 10+/-3% in TAK1 with TNF-alpha). Interestingly, AMPK-alpha1KD THP-1 cells were highly sensitive to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in a time-dependent manner as compared with that of wt THP-1 cells (Figure 5c, wt THP-1; Figure 5d, AMPK-alpha1KD). To verify the results, we performed caspase activity and DNA laddering assay in the same condition. Consistently, the activities of caspase 3, caspase 9, and caspase 8 were markedly higher in AMPK-alpha1KD THP-1 cells than that in wt THP-1 cells activities (Figure 5e, caspase 3; Figure 5f, caspase 9; Figure 5g, caspase 8). Moreover, similar results could be seen in DNA laddering assay (Figure 5h). These results suggest that AMPK-alpha1 is functionally involved in TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis through the regulation of TAK1 activity.
TNF-alpha signaling is transduced through its receptors to simultaneously elicit two opposing effects: the induction of apoptosis and the transcription of anti-apoptotic genes.26, 27 We therefore examined whether the effects of AMPK-alpha1 on TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis are linked to the expression of NF-kappaB-dependent genes and pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic genes; we performed gene expression analysis of wt and AMPK-alpha1KD THP-1 cells with or without TNF-alpha stimulation, respectively. According to stimulation of TNF-alpha, marked changes in gene expression profiles could be detected (Supplementary Figure 5). When we compared gene-expression profiles related to NF-kappaB-dependent genes, marked changes could also be observed (Figure 6a, Supplementary Table 2a and Supplementary Table 2b). qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that five different genes such as IL-1beta, IL-8, TNF-alpha, CCL5, and CD44 were greatly upregulated in TNF-alpha-treated wt THP-1 cells as compared with that of without stimulation, whereas minute changes could be detected in TNF-alpha-treated AMPK-alpha1KD THP-1 cells, as compared with that of without stimulation (Figure 6b). Similar results could also be detected in qRT-PCR analysis of NF-KB1A, NF-KB1A, NF-B1E, REL, BCL3, and IER3 (Supplementary Figure 6), indicating that AMPK-alpha1 is functionally related to the expression of NF-kappaB-dependent genes in response to TNF-alpha stimulation.
Suppression of AMPK- alpha 1 is associated with the expression of pro- or anti-apoptotic genes in response to TNF-alpha stimulation
We further assessed whether the sensitivity on TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in AMPK-alpha1KD cells is associated with the gene expression profiles related to apoptosis. According to stimulation of TNF-alpha, marked changes in both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic gene expression profiles could be detected (Figure 7a, Supplementary Tables 3a, 3b and 4a, 4b). To verify these gene expression profiles, we selected four different pro-apoptotic genes, such as PTEN, LTA, MAGED1, and TNFRFS21, and four different anti-apoptotic genes, such as SGK1, PI3KCB, BCL2L2, and BCL2, and performed qRT-PCR analysis. The pro-apoptotic genes were markedly increased in AMPK-alpha1KD cells non-treated with TNF-alpha, as compared with that of wt THP-1 cells (Figure 7b, AMPK-alpha1KD versus wt THP-1 in the group without stimulation of TNF-alpha). According to stimulation of TNF-alpha, moreover, two of them, PTEN and LTA, were significantly enhanced in AMPK-alpha1KD cells (Figure 7b, upper panels). The obtained result was critically consistent with previous reports, which state that PTEN expression augments TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis through the inhibition of NF-kappaB transcriptional activity.28, 29 In contrast, the anti-apoptotic genes, such as SGK1, PI3KCB, and BCL2L2, were significantly enhanced by the stimulation of TNF-alpha in wt THP-1 cells, whereas no significant changes could be detected in AMPK-alpha1KD cells (Figure 7c). Overall, these results strongly provide evidence that the TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in AMPK-alpha1KD cells is associated with expressions of pro- or anti-apoptotic genes related to NF-kappaB transcriptional activity.
Discussion
Our experiments demonstrate that AMPK-alpha1 critically regulates TLR4-mediated signaling pathway through the activation of TAK1. We found that autoinhibitory domain of AMPK-alpha1 interacts with the N-terminus of TAK1. The masking of autoinhibitory domain of AMPK-alpha1 seems to be critically associated with the activation of AMPK-alpha1 by TAK1,30 which led us to speculate that AMPK-alpha1 might regulate the activity of TAK1 through the intermolecular interaction. In terms of the activity of AMPK-alpha1, the inhibition of AMPK-alpha1 activity with a pharmacological compound, compound C, revealed a dramatic reduction in NF-kappaB and AP-1 activities, and production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta, in response to LPS stimulation. Moreover, we found that a constitutive active form of AMPK-alpha1 significantly augmented these activities induced by LPS treatment, but not in a DN form as AMPK-alpha1. These results suggest that AMPK-alpha1 is functionally involved in TLR4-mediated signaling through the molecular interaction with TAK1.
The TAK1 was originally identified as a TGF-beta-activated kinase.1, 2, 3 The TAK1 is involved in distinct cellular signals such as Wnt, bone morphogenetic protein, activin, and TGF-beta-signaling pathways.3, 31, 32 In addition, TAK1 has a major role in both innate and adaptive immunity pathways.5, 6, 7, 8 We found that, in AMPK-alpha1-knockdown THP-1 cells, TAK1 phosphorylation was markedly reduced in response to LPS stimulation when compared with that of wt THP-1 cells. In agreement with previous reports,22, 23, 24 phosphorylations of JNK, p38, and AKT were impaired in LPS-treated AMPK-alpha1-knockdown THP-1 cells, indicating that AMPK has an important role in promoting p38, JNK, AKT activations. Furthermore, DNA-binding activities of p65, p50, c-Fos, and c-Jun were markedly reduced in AMPK-alpha1-knockdown THP-1 cells. In AMPK-alpha1-knockdown THP-1 cells, dramatic reductions in TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta could be detected in response to LPS stimulation. Moreover, microarray and qRT-PCR analysis targeted to NF-kappaB-dependent genes critically revealed marked reductions of the expression of these genes in AMPK-alpha1-knockdown THP-1 cells after LPS treatment. These results strongly support the hypothesis that AMPK-alpha1 is critically required for TLR4-mediated signaling, thus leading to activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1, and thereby regulating expressions of NF-kappaB-dependent genes.
To verify the functional role of AMPK-alpha1 capable of regulating TAK1 activity, we confirmed the effects in another system, TFN-alpha-induced apoptosis. Previous studies have shown that TAK1 has a protective role against TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis through the activation of NF-kappaB.3, 4 Interestingly, AMPK-alpha1-knockdown cells were highly sensitive to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis along with a marked reduction in the levels of NF-kappaB-dependent genes as compared with those of wt THP-1 cells. When we analyzed the expression of anti-apoptotic genes and pro-apoptotic genes in AMPK-alpha1-knockdown or wt THP-1 cells after TNF-alpha treatment, furthermore, marked inductions of pro-apoptotic genes could be detected, whereas significant reductions in anti-apoptotic genes could be detected in AMPK-alpha1-knockdown THP-1 cells. These results were similar to that of TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in TAK1-/-MEF cells. Therefore, the obtained results support a pivotal role of AMPK-alpha1 as an upstream kinase of TAK1, which eventually lead to express NF-kappaB-dependent genes related in the protection to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis.
Although it is not completely understood as how TAK1 activity is biochemically regulated, its activation seems to require TAK1-binding proteins such as TAB1, TAB2, and TAB3. In addition, a plausible model about how to activate TAK1 in innate signaling has been proposed in a recent report.6 Binding of IL-1beta to IL-1R or LPS to TLR4 causes recruitment of adopter proteins such as MyD88, IRAK, and TRAF6 to the receptor. The TRAF6 in turn catalyzes synthesis of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. The polyubiquitin chains acts as a scaffold motif to recruit the TAK1 and IKK complexes through binding to the regulatory subunits TAB2 and NEMO, respectively. Recruitment of the kinase complexes facilitates autophosphorylation of TAK1 and subsequent phosphorylation of IKKbeta by TAK1, thus leading to IkappaB degradation and subsequent activation of NF-kappaB. Our data propose a potential possibility that TAK1 activity in both TLR4- and TNF-alpha-mediated signaling pathway may be regulated by AMPK-alpha1 as an upstream kinase of TAK1. Taken together, our data are summarized in Figure 8. Binding of LPS derived from bacterial components to TLR4 initiates intracellular-signaling cascades, initially leading to the recruitment of adaptor molecules such as MyD88, IRAKs, and Mal proteins. Two critical events for the activation of TAK1 may occur in the middle of signaling cascades. Upon the TLR4 stimulation, the activation of AMPK-alpha1 is simultaneously induced by LKB1 and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and then activated AMPK-alpha1 can induce activation of JNK/p38MAPK pathway, thereby inducing activations of AP-1 components such as c-Jun and c-fos. Simultaneously, activated AMPK-alpha1 specifically interacts with TAK1 through the molecular interaction between N-terminus of TAK1 and autoinhibitory domain of AMPK-alpha1, and subsequently induces the phosphorylation of TAK1 for the activation. In turn, the activated TAK1 subsequently induces the phosphorylation of IKKbeta, leading to IkappaB degradation and activation of NF-kappaB. Nevertheless, the existence of other upstream kinases capable of inducing TAK1 activation and the reciprocal regulation between TAK1 and AMPK-alpha1 is not completely ruled out. Therefore, future studies elucidating the specific molecular mechanism may contribute towards more detailed understanding on the functional roles played by TAK1 as a key element kinase in different innate signaling pathways.

Levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 were measured in the supernatants, according to the manufacturer's protocol (R&D Systems).
p65/p50 (NF-kappaB) and c-Fos/c-Jun (AP-1) DNA-binding assay by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
Nuclear proteins from transfectants treated with or without LPS were prepared with CelLyticTM NuCLEARTM Extraction kit in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Activities of transcription factors, p65, p50, c-Jun, and c-Fos, were determined with TransAM NF-kappaB or AP-1 transcription factor assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Active Motif North America, Carlsbad, CA, USA).4, 34 Briefly, a specific double-stranded DNA sequence containing the NF-kappaB or AP-1 response element was immobilized on a 96-well plate, and the binding of the activated p65 or p50 to the NF-kappaB response element and c-fos or c-Jun to the AP-1 response element was achieved by incubating nuclear extracts in the presence of binding buffer. The interaction between the protein-DNA complexes was detected by the addition of specific antibodies against p65, p50, c-fos, or pho-c-Jun. Addition of a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase provided a sensitive colorimetric readout at 450 nm.
Plasmids and mutagenesis
The pcDNA3-Flag-hAMPK-alpha1 wt was kindly provided by Dr. SJUm.35 The pcDNA3-Myc-hTAK1 wt was generated by PCR, using HeLa cDNA library as a template, and inserted into pcDNA3.

Immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis
Transfected HEK 293 cells with appropriate expression vectors were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1.5% aprotinin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. Co-immunoprecipitation procedures were followed as previously described.4, 36 For immunoprecipitation and western blotting, we used anti-Myc and anti-Flag antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich). The proteins were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Amersham, UK). For endogenous immunoprecipitation, THP-1 cells were treated with or without LPS (100 ng/ml) for 45 min. Cells were extracted and immunoprecipitated with anti-TAK1 antibody. The interaction was detected by western blotting with anti-AMPK-alpha1 antibody. The same lysates were verified with anti-TAK1 antibody.
In vitro kinase assay for TAK1 and AMPK-alpha1
Wt THP-1, AMPK-alpha1KD, and TAK1KD THP-1 cells were treated with or without LPS (100 ng/ml) for different times. The kinase assay for TAK1 and AMPK-alpha1 was performed by c-TAK1 Kinase Assay kit (U-TRF#17, PerkinElmer, Branchburg, NJ, USA) and AMPK-alpha1 Kinase assay kit (U-TRF#12, PerkinElmer) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol.
Measurement of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 activities
Wt THP-1 and AMPK-alpha1KD THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI medium containing 2% FBS. Cells were treated with or without TNF-alpha (100 ng/ml) for different times, harvested, and washed twice with PBS. Caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 activities were measured using the CaspACE kit (Promega) according to the manufacture's instructions.33
DNA fragmentation analysis
Cells were homogenized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubated for 15 h at 42 degreesC under constant agitation. Proteins were then precipitated with 6 M NaCl and centrifuged at 2500 x g at 4 degreesC for 15 min. Supernatants containing genomic DNA were then treated with RNase A at 37 degreesC for 30 min. The genomic DNA was precipitated for 3 h at -70 degreesC with 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol and 0.2 volumes of 3 M sodium acetate. Samples were then centrifuged at 20 800 x g at 4 degreesC for 30 min. The resulting pellets were washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in 40 mul of nuclease-free water. Genomic DNA extracts (10-20 mul) were run on 1.8% agarose gels and visualized under UV illumination.
Cell cycle and apoptosis analysis
Wt THP-1 and AMPK-alpha1KD THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI medium containing 2% FBS. Cells were treated with or without TNF-alpha (100 ng/ml) for different times, harvested, and washed twice with PBS. The cells were stained with FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) or BD Cycletest Plus-DNA Reagent kit (BD Biosciences) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were analyzed with FACSCalibur system and then apoptotic cell death was determined with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) or Modfit LT 3.0 software (Becton Dickinson).
Microarray analysis
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and purified using RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers' protocol. After processing with DNase digestion, and clean-up procedures, RNA samples were quantified, aliquoted, and stored at -80 degreesC until use. For quality control, RNA purity and integrity were evaluated by denaturing gel electrophoresis, OD 260/280 ratio, and analyzed on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Total RNA was amplified and purified using the Ambion Illumina RNA amplification kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) to yield biotinylated cRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 550 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a T7 oligo(dT) primer. Second-strand cDNA was synthesized, in vitro transcribed, and labeled with biotin-NTP. After purification, the cRNA was quantified using the ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Wilmington, NC, USA). Typically, 750 ng of labeled cRNA samples were hybridized to each humanHT-12 expression v.4 bead array for 16-18 h at 58 degreesC, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Detection of array signal was carried out using Amersham fluorolink streptavidin-Cy3 (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK) following the bead array manual. Arrays were scanned with an Illumina bead array Reader confocal scanner according to the manufacturer's instructions. For raw data preparation and statistical analysis, the quality of hybridization and overall chip performance were monitored by visual inspection of both internal quality control checks and the raw scanned data. Raw data were extracted using the software provided by the manufacturer (Illumina GenomeStudio v2009.2 (Gene Expression Module v1.5.4)). Array data were filtered by detection of P-value <0.05 (similar to signal to noise) in at least 50% samples (we applied a filtering criterion for data analysis; higher signal value was required to obtain a detection P-value <0.05). Selected gene signal value was transformed by logarithm and normalized by quantile method. The comparative analysis between test sample and control sample was carried out using fold change. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using complete linkage and Euclidean distance as a measure of similarity. GO-ontology analysis for significant probe list was performed using PANTHER (http://www.pantherdb.org/panther/ontologies.jsp), using text files containing Gene ID list and accession number of illumina probe ID. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed to check whether the a priori defined set of genes shows a differential pattern in both the biological process and the molecular function states. One-tail Fisher Exact was adopted to measure the gene enrichment in annotation terms. All the data analysis and visualization of differentially expressed genes was conducted using R 2.4.1(www.r-project.org).
Gene expression analysis by qPCR
Isolation of total RNA, and cDNA synthesis, were performed following the protocols provided along with the kit (Qiagen). For qPCR analysis, qPCR primers were purchased from Qiagen: IL-8 (PDH 00568A), TNF (PDH 00341E), CD44 (PDH 00114A), CCL5 (PDH 00703A), NF-KB1 (PDH 00204E), NF-KB1A (PDH 00170E), NF-KB1E (PDH 01810E), RELB (PDH 00287A), IER3 (PDH 10008E), REL (PDH 00101B), BCL3 (PDH 02009C), IL-1B (PDH 00171B), PTEN (PDH 00327E), LTA (PDH 00337E), MAGED1 (PDH 01965A), TNFRFS21 (PDH 00262A), SGK1 (PDH 00387E), PI3KCB (PDH 00789A), BCL2L2 (PDH 00081E), and BCL2 (PDH 00079B). The qRT-PCR analysis was performed using Roter-GeneQ (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers' protocol.
Statistical analysis
Data were presented as mean values+/-S.D. as indicated and analyzed using Student's two-tailed t-test. A P-value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

Schematic model showing role of AMPK-alpha1 as an upstream kinase of TAK1 in TLR4-mediated signaling pathway. Binding of LPS derived from bacterial components to TLR4 initiates intracellular signaling cascades, initially leading to the recruitment of adapter molecules such as MyD88, IRAKs, and Mal proteins. Two critical events for the activation of TAK1 may occur in the middle of signaling cascades. Upon TLR4 stimulation, the activation of AMPK-alpha1 is simultaneously induced by LKB1 and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and then activated AMPK-alpha1 can induce activation of JNK/p38MAPK pathway, thereby inducing activations of AP-1 components such as c-Jun and c-fos. Simultaneously, activated AMPK-alpha1 specifically interacts with TAK1 through the molecular interaction between N-terminus of TAK1 and autoinhibitory domain of AMPK-alpha1, and then AMPK-alpha1 and TAK1 reciprocally induces phosphorylations of TAK1 for the activation. In turn, the activated TAK1 subsequently induces the phosphorylation of IKKbeta, leading to IkappaB degradation and activation of NF-kappaB. Subsequently, proinflammatory cytokine genes such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 are expressed
