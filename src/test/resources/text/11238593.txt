Both nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) and inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB) kinase (IKK) have been implicated as essential components for NF-kappaB activation in response to many external stimuli. However, the exact roles of NIK and IKKalpha in cytokine signaling still remain controversial. With the use of in vivo mouse models, rather than with enforced gene-expression systems, we have investigated the role of NIK and IKKalpha in signaling through the type I tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (TNFR-I) and the lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR), a receptor essential for lymphoid organogenesis. TNF stimulation induced similar levels of phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha in embryonic fibroblasts from either wild-type or NIK-mutant mice. In contrast, LTbetaR stimulation induced NF-kappaB activation in wild-type mice, but the response was impaired in embryonic fibroblasts from NIK-mutant and IKKalpha-deficient mice. Consistent with the essential role of IKKalpha in LTbetaR signaling, we found that development of Peyer's patches was defective in IKKalpha-deficient mice. These results demonstrate that both NIK and IKKalpha are essential for the induction of NF-kappaB through LTbetaR, whereas the NIK-IKKalpha pathway is dispensable in TNFR-I signaling.
alymphoplasia cytokine signaling IkappaB Akt kinase Peyer's patch
Introduction
The transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB plays a pivotal role in the regulation of innate immunity, stress responses, inflammation, and the inhibition of apoptosis 12. The activity of NF-kappaB is tightly regulated by cytokines and other external stimuli. In most cell types, NF-kappaB is present as a heterodimer comprising 50-kD (p50) and 65-kD (p65) subunits and is sequestered in the cytoplasm by a member of the inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB) family of inhibitory proteins. NF-kappaB activation requires the degradation of IkappaB proteins, and the mechanisms of IkappaB degradation and subsequent NF-kappaB activation have been the subject of intense investigation 3. Those studies have revealed two important classes of kinase involved in this pathway: mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) and its downstream target, IkappaB kinase (IKK) 45. NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) is structurally related to MAP3K and has been identified as a TNFR-associated factor (TRAF)2-interacting protein 6. On the basis of the finding that kinase-inactive mutants of NIK transfected into 293-EBNA cells abolished NF-kappaB activation in response to TNF or by cotransfection with type I TNF receptor (TNFR-I), NIK was considered to be involved in an NF-kappaB-inducing signaling cascade induced by TNF 6. Subsequently, NIK was demonstrated to phosphorylate IKKalpha and IKKbeta, which directly associate with IkappaBalpha and specifically phosphorylate it on serines 32 and 36 45. These studies suggested that interaction of NIK and IKK constitutes an essential step for NF-kappaB activation. However, in vivo studies with mutant mice have thrown some doubt on the essential roles of NIK and IKKalpha in NF-kappaB activation, at least as induced by TNF. The alymphoplasia (aly) mouse is a natural strain with a mutated NIK 7. Despite the NIK mutation, upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) after stimulation with TNF was present in aly mouse embryonic fibroblasts (EFs) 8. It was also reported that aly mice exhibited similar TNF-mediated endotoxin shock after generalized LPS administration 7. These observations suggested that NIK was not a critical element in the TNF signaling pathway to NF-kappaB activation. The in vivo role of IKK in NF-kappaB activation was also examined using gene-targeted mice. Although TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation was markedly reduced in IKKbeta-deficient EFs 910, NF-kappaB activation from IKKalpha-deficient EFs was normal 1112 or diminished but still present 13 after stimulation with TNF. Surprisingly, mice deficient in IKKalpha showed perinatal death associated with limb and skin abnormalities, suggesting that IKKalpha plays an essential role in the regulation of gene expression required for the development of limb and skin rather than for TNF signaling 111213. Thus, the role of NIK-IKKalpha in NF-kappaB activation through TNFR signaling requires further investigation.
The lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR) has emerged as a signaling system required for the development of lymphoid organs 1415. Although LTbetaR has been shown to bind TRAF2, -3, -4, and -5, but not TRAF6 1617, and to activate NF-kappaB after receptor ligation 18, the molecular mechanisms by which LTbetaR exerts its biological activities are still poorly understood. aly mice and LT ligand- or LTbetaR-deficient mice share a unique phenotype, which includes the lack of LN and Peyer's patches (PPs) and a disturbed splenic architecture 71415. Therefore, we speculated that NIK plays a role in LTbetaR signaling. This hypothesis was supported by the demonstration that upregulation of VCAM-1 after stimulation with agonistic anti-LTbetaR mAb was absent from aly mouse EFs 8.
Phenotypic analyses of mutant and gene-targeted mice, as described above, have unveiled the essential roles of NIK in lymphoid organogenesis and of IKKalpha in limb and skin development. However, the roles of NIK and IKKalpha in cytokine signaling still remain controversial. We have approached this question with the use of in vivo mouse models. Here, we show that NIK-IKKalpha constitutes an essential pathway for the induction of NF-kappaB through LTbetaR, whereas this pathway is dispensable in TNFR-I signaling.
Materials and Methods
Mice.
aly/+, aly/aly, and C57BL/6J mice were purchased from CLEA Japan. The mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions and were handled in accordance with the Guidelines for Animal Experimentation of Tokushima University School of Medicine. The experiments were initiated at 8-12 wk of age. IKKalpha-deficient mice were generated by gene targeting as described previously and maintained at Osaka University 11.
Use of EF to Assess Signaling through TNFR-I and LTbetaR.
EFs were established as described previously 811. EFs from aly/aly mice, IKKalpha-deficient mice, and C57BL/6J wild-type mice were cultured in DMEM (GIBCO BRL) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS (GIBCO BRL), 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mug/ml streptomycin at a density of 7 x 105 cells per 60-mm culture dish. After incubation with control mAb Ha4/8 (2 mug/ml), agonistic anti-LTbetaR mAb AC.H6 (2 mug/ml; reference 19), or recombinant human TNF (Genzyme, Inc.), whole cell lysates were harvested from the dish with a lysis buffer containing 1% NP-40 (Sigma-Aldrich) and subjected to Western blot analysis as described previously 20. The following Abs were used: rabbit antipeptide Ab directed against IkappaBalpha (cat. no. sc-371; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-specific IkappaBalpha (cat. no. 9241; New England Biolabs), and polyclonal rabbit Ab against actin (Biomedical Technologies). For blockade of the phosphatidylinositol-3'-OH kinase (PI[3]K)-Akt pathway, EFs were treated with 1 muM wortmannin (Calbiochem) for 30 min before stimulation with TNF. For blockade of proteasome activity, EFs were treated with 100 muM N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN; Nacalai Tesque) for 1 h.
Use of NF-kappaB Reporter Assay to Assess Signaling through TNFR-I and LTbetaR.
EFs cultured in a 35-mm culture dish (2 x 105 cells) were transfected with 2 mug of a reporter plasmid comprising three repeats of the NF-kappaB site upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter and a luciferase gene in the pGL-2 vector (Promega), together with 2 mug of beta-actin promoter-driven beta-galactosidase expression plasmid. Transfected cells were incubated in the presence of recombinant human TNF (100 U/ml) or agonistic anti-LTbetaR mAb AC.H6 for 8 h. After 24 h, the cells were harvested in PBS and lysed in a luciferase lysis buffer, LC-beta (Piccagene). Luciferase assays were performed with a luminometer (Lumat LB 9507; Berthold). Activity was normalized to beta-galactosidase activity, and data were expressed as the fold activation compared with stimulation by control anti-KLH hamster mAb Ha4/8.
Assessment of LTbetaR Expression on EFs with Flow-cytometric Analysis.
EFs were incubated with anti-LTbetaR mAb AF.H6 19 or control mAb Ha4/8. After washing twice with PBS, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-hamster IgG mAb (clone G94-56; PharMingen). Cells were analyzed with a FACSCaliber(TM) flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) with CELLQuest(TM) software. Mouse mAb-producing hybridoma cells were used as negative control.
Assessment of PP Formation with Whole-Mount Immunohistochemistry.
Whole-mount immunohistochemistry for the detection of PP was performed as described 21. In brief, 2% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4)-fixed intestines from 18.5 days postcoitus (d.p.c.) embryos were incubated with mAb against VCAM-1 (PharMingen) and then with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rat Ig (Tago Immunologicals). Color development for bound HRP was done with diaminobenzidine.
Assessment of Association between NIK and IKKalpha.
Proteins were expressed by transfecting expression constructs with the indicated cDNAs into COS-7 cells. Extracts were prepared 30 h after transfection. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis was performed as described previously 2022. Full-sized, Flag-tagged wild-type NIK 6, Flag-tagged aly-type NIK, and Myc-tagged IKKalpha 22 were expressed in pCR3 vectors (Invitrogen); aly-type NIK cDNA was generated by the introduction of an amino acid substitution (G860R) into the COOH-terminal region of human NIK 7 by site-directed mutagenesis. Anti-Flag mAb (clone M2) and anti-Myc mAb (clone 9E10) were from Sigma-Aldrich and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively.
Results and Discussion
Retained TNFR-I Signaling in NIK-mutant EFs.
NIK was originally identified as a kinase that participates in an NF-kappaB-inducing signaling cascade induced by TNF, CD95, and IL-1 6. To assess the impact of NIK mutation in TNF responsiveness, we treated EFs from both wild-type and aly mice with human TNF, which signals only through mouse TNFR-I 23, and assessed NF-kappaB activation by Western blot analysis. Rapid IkappaBalpha degradation concomitant with the appearance of phosphorylated IkappaBalpha was observed with similar kinetics in EFs from both wild-type and aly mice (Fig. 1 A). 30 min after stimulation with TNF, IkappaBalpha started to recover similarly in both wild-type and aly mice (Fig. 1 B). IkappaBbeta degradation in response to TNF was also indistinguishable between wild-type and aly mice (data not shown). We also tested TNF responsiveness by titrating the TNF concentration between 0.1 and 100 U/ml. In this range, TNF sensitivity assessed by IkappaBalpha degradation, and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation was indistinguishable between wild-type and aly mice (Fig. 1 C). Using an NF-kappaB-binding oligonucleotide probe in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we also observed a very similar level of NF-kappaB activation between wild-type and aly mice in TNF-stimulated EFs or TNF-stimulated thymocytes (data not shown). Furthermore, IL-1 and IL-6 production from TNF-stimulated EFs was indistinguishable between wild-type and aly mice (data not shown). These results demonstrate that NF-kappaB activation through TNFR-I is not affected by the NIK mutation.
Recently, it was demonstrated that Akt serine-threonine kinase is involved in the activation of NF-kappaB by TNF 24. Although the results described above do not suggest a role for NIK in TNFR-I signaling, it is possible that NIK plays an important role in NF-kappaB activation in combination with Akt. We therefore tested the combined effect of NIK and Akt in the NF-kappaB-inducing pathway downstream of the TNFR-I. IkappaBalpha degradation occurred 10 min after TNF stimulation in wild-type EFs, even in the presence of 1 muM wortmannin, a sufficient concentration for blockade of the PI(3)K-Akt pathway (references 24 and 25; Fig. 1 D). This suggests that Akt, the downstream target of PI(3)K, by itself has no major role in NF-kappaB activation by TNF. Additionally, no obvious effect of wortmannin on IkappaBalpha degradation was observed in aly mouse EFs, indicating that NF-kappaB activation by TNF can occur even when the functions of both NIK and Akt are inhibited. We failed to observe phosphorylation of Akt in response to TNF when we probed the same blot with phospho-specific anti-Akt Ab in this experimental setting (data not shown). These results suggest that neither NIK nor Akt is essential for NF-kappaB activation by TNF and that other IKK kinase(s) can substitute for NIK and Akt in NF-kappaB activation by TNF, at least in EFs. Elucidation of the IKK kinase(s) that activates IKK in response to TNF awaits further study.
Indispensable Role of NIK and IKKalpha in NF-kappaB Activation through LTbetaR.
We intended to evaluate the role of NIK in TNFR-I and LTbetaR signaling with the use of in vivo mouse models, rather than introducing enforced gene-expression systems. To this end, we transfected EFs (which express both TNFR-I and LTbetaR) only with a reporter plasmid that has three repeats of the NF-kappaB site upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter and a luciferase gene, and then stimulated the transfected EFs with TNF or agonistic anti-LTbetaR mAb (AC.H6). EFs from both wild-type and aly mice showed upregulation of luciferase activity in response to human TNF (Fig. 2 A). The normal level of TNF responsiveness in aly mice is consistent with the results shown above (Fig. 1). In contrast to TNF stimulation, NF-kappaB activation in response to agonistic anti-LTbetaR mAb was significantly reduced in aly mouse EFs, indicating that NIK is involved in LTbetaR signaling (Fig. 2 A).
With the combination of EFs and agonistic anti-LTbetaR mAb, signals for NF-kappaB activation assessed by EMSA were not strong enough to evaluate the role of NIK in NF-kappaB activation through the LTbetaR (our unpublished observation). Involvement of NIK in LTbetaR signaling was therefore examined by detection of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation in response to agonistic anti-LTbetaR mAb. In wild-type EFs stimulated with agonistic anti-LTbetaR mAb for 1 h, IkappaBalpha phosphorylation was easily detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, aly mouse EFs showed minimal, if any, phosphorylated IkappaBalpha after LTbetaR stimulation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that NIK is essential for NF-kappaB activation in LTbetaR signaling, which accounts for the abnormal lymphoid organogenesis in aly mice.
We have previously demonstrated that EFs isolated from IKKalpha-deficient mice can activate NF-kappaB in response to TNF and IL-1, suggesting that IKKalpha is not essential for either the TNF or IL-1 signaling pathways 11. The dispensable role of IKKalpha in NF-kappaB activation through TNFR-I was also confirmed by the detection of phosphorylated IkappaBalpha in IKKalpha-deficient EFs after TNF stimulation (Fig. 2 C). Because NIK is essential for LTbetaR signaling, as demonstrated above, and NIK has been shown to phosphorylate IKKalpha 26, it is important to determine whether IKKalpha is also essential for LTbetaR signaling. We therefore treated EFs from IKKalpha-deficient mice with agonistic anti-LTbetaR mAb and assessed NF-kappaB activation by the detection of phosphorylated IkappaBalpha. We found that IKKalpha-deficient EFs showed no IkappaBalpha phosphorylation after LTbetaR stimulation, suggesting that NIK-IKKalpha constitutes an important pathway in LTbetaR signaling (Fig. 2 B). LTbetaR expression assessed by flow-cytometric analysis with anti-LTbetaR mAb (AF.H6) was similar among wild-type, aly, and IKKalpha-deficient EFs (Fig. 2 D). The basal level of NF-kappaB activation, assessed by the treatment of EFs with ALLN alone, which blocks the degradation of phosphorylated IkappaBalpha by proteasomes 3, was reduced in aly mice and reduced more profoundly in IKKalpha-deficient mice (Fig. 2 B).
The essential role of IKKalpha in LTbetaR signaling was examined by investigation of lymphoid organogenesis in IKKalpha-deficient mice. Because IKKalpha-deficient mice show perinatal death associated with abnormal limb and skin development, lymphoid organogenesis in IKKalpha-deficient mice was assessed by the development of PP from 18.5 d.p.c. embryos. PP formation in control embryos (n = 8) was easily detected by whole-mount immunohistochemistry with mAb against VCAM-1 (Fig. 3 A); VCAM-1+ cells accumulate at the site of PP development starting from 15.5 d.p.c. and can be used as a stromal marker for PP formation 21. In contrast, no PP formation was detected in intestines isolated from IKKalpha-deficient embryos (n = 7; Fig. 3 B). A similar lack of VCAM-1+ cell accumulation in embryonic intestines has been demonstrated in aly mice 21. This result shows that LTbetaR signaling is fundamentally impaired in IKKalpha-deficient mice. Together, these findings are important in providing clear evidence that IKKalpha is involved in cytokine receptor signaling in vivo.
It is important to note that abnormal lymphoid organogenesis in IKKalpha-deficient mice is not due to defective receptor activator of NF-kappaB (RANK) signaling, because mice deficient in RANK have PPs despite their lack of peripheral LNs 27; RANK activates NF-kappaB by recruiting TRAF6, which has not been observed to associate with LTbetaR 1617. It remains possible, however, that there exist other undefined NIK-IKKalpha-activating receptor pathways involved in lymphoid organogenesis beyond LTbetaR.
The above data strongly suggest that NIK and IKKalpha together control LTbetaR signaling with a close mechanistic relationship in their pathway. We have therefore reasoned that impaired LTbetaR signaling in aly mice may be due to defective interaction between mutated NIK and IKKalpha. To investigate this, NIK and IKKalpha were coexpressed in COS-7 cells, and protein interactions were assessed by immunoprecipitation. Association of wild-type NIK with IKKalpha was easily detected (Fig. 4). In contrast, association of aly type NIK, which corresponds to a G855R substitution in mice, with IKKalpha was disrupted by the mutation, providing further support for the role of NIK-IKKalpha as an essential pathway for NF-kappaB activation in LTbetaR signaling. Despite this finding, the possibility remains that aly mice might have a different phenotype from NIK-null mutation mice.
It is unclear whether TRAFs mediate all of the signaling activities of LTbetaR. In fact, mice deficient in TRAF2, -3, or -5 show LN development 2829. In support of the dispensable role of TRAFs in LTbetaR signaling, recent mutational analyses of the cytoplasmic region of LTbetaR have demonstrated a TRAF-independent mechanism of NF-kappaB activation through LTbetaR 30. Consistent with this idea, TRAF-NIK interaction in COS-7 cells as assessed by immunoprecipitation was not affected by the aly mutation (our unpublished observation), although the aly mutation resides in a putative TRAF-binding domain of NIK 31. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which NIK becomes activated after LTbetaR stimulation will be critical for understanding the biological nature of LTbetaR signaling.

NF-kappaB activation in response to TNF is retained in EFs from NIK-mutant mice. EFs from wild-type mice (WT) and aly mice (aly) were stimulated with TNF (100 U/ml), and cells were harvested at the indicated time points (A and B). IkappaBalpha degradation (detected by anti-IkappaBalpha Ab) and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation (detected by phospho-specific anti-IkappaBalpha Ab) was assessed by Western blot analysis. Arrow indicates phosphorylated IkappaBalpha (A). EFs were stimulated with different concentrations (Conc.) of TNF ranging from 0.1 to 100 U/ml as indicated, and cells were harvested 7 min after stimulation (C). EFs were stimulated with TNF (100 U/ml) with or without prior treatment with 1 muM wortmannin (D). The same blot was probed with anti-actin Ab (bottom).

Impaired NF-kappaB activation in response to LTbetaR stimulation in NIK-mutant and IKKalpha-deficient EFs. Wild-type EFs and aly mouse EFs were transfected with NF-kappaB reporter plasmids and stimulated with TNF or agonistic anti-LTbetaR mAb. 8 h later, NF-kappaB activation was assessed by the measurement of luciferase activities. Data were expressed as fold activation compared with stimulation by control mAb, and the results were plotted as the mean +/- SEM for a total of four independent experiments. White and black bars represent wild-type EFs and aly mouse EFs, respectively (A). EFs from wild-type, aly, and IKKalpha-deficient mice (IKKalpha-/-) were stimulated with agonistic anti-LTbetaR mAb for 1 h, and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation was assessed by Western blot analysis (B, top). For the assessment of the basal level of NF-kappaB activation, EFs were treated with ALLN alone. Phosphorylated IkappaBalpha is indicated as P. NS, nonspecific bands. The same blot was probed with anti-actin Ab (B, bottom). TNF stimulation induced IkappaBalpha phosphorylation in IKKalpha-deficient EFs as in wild-type and aly EFs (C). LTbetaR expression assessed by flow-cytometric analysis with anti-LTbetaR mAb (D, thick line) was similar among wild-type, aly, and IKKalpha-deficient EFs (D). Anti-KLH mAb Ha4/8 (D, thin line) and mouse hybridoma cells (top left) were used as negative control.

Lack of PP development in IKKalpha-deficient mice. Embryonic intestines isolated from control littermates (A) and IKKalpha-deficient mice (B) were stained with anti-VCAM-1 mAb. Arrows indicate the sites of PPs. Original magnification, x10.
Figure 4
Disruption of interaction with IKKalpha by the aly-type NIK mutation. Protein extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with the indicated cDNAs were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc mAb and detected with either anti-Flag mAb (top) or anti-Myc mAb (center). Expression of NIK was verified by Western blot analysis of total cell lysates with anti-Flag mAb (bottom). aly-type NIK (aly) has an amino acid substitution (G860R) in the COOH-terminal region. Minus (-) indicates transfection with empty vectors.
